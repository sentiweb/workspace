Title: Workspace helps to organize a set of projects sharing common config
Version: 0.2.0
Description: A workpace is a set of R projects (each project in a subdirectory of the workspace root). Workspace package provides 
    functions to find the root of the workspace, and load a workspace-wide configuration (shared accros the projects in the workspace directory) and
    provides functions to manage paths outside the project avoiding the need to use absolute path.
